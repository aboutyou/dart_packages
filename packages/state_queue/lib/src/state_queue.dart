  ///
  /// While [run] takes an `async*` function, the completion of the scheduled
  /// function can not be awaited from the caller.
  /// Hence any function in a [StateQueue] implementation purely calling [run]
  /// should not be async itself, as to not mislead the caller of the bloc method
  /// to expect that all computation is done once the method on the bloc succeeds.
  ///
  /// DON'T DO THIS, because the [Future] returned by `append` would complete immediately,
  /// while the function passed to `run` wouldn't even have started.
  ///
  /// ```dart
  /// Future<void> append(String suffix) async {
  ///   run(
  ///     (state) async* {
  ///       yield state + suffix;
  ///     },
  ///   );
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  /// The reason for this lack of awaitability is that bloc methods are generally called
  /// from widgets, which should not await their result for the purpose of coordinating
  /// between blocs.
  ///
  ///
  ///
  /// Also be aware of the implications using multiple individual [run]s inside one bloc method.
  /// While there are a few legitimate cases to do this, most of them involve checking the
  /// passed `state` to find out whether the next update should still be yielded, or whether
  /// it's obsolete now because the state was already changed by another invocation.
  /// Usually it's correct and also much simpler to have a single [run] invocation in a bloc
  /// method which `awaits`s and `yield`s as much as it needs to. The guarantee that this
  /// async [updater] will not be interrupted by any other state changes makes it much
  /// easier to reason about.
  ///
  ///
  /// Since [updater] functions `yield` new states, they are free to yield more than one state
  ///
  /// State changes are not immediately reflected inside the [run].
  /// If you call a method from a [run] which accesses `state` or `value`, it might not have the updated state yet when this function runs.
  ///
  ///   /// ```dart
  /// Future<void> append(String suffix)  async{
  ///   run(
  ///     (state) async* {
  ///       yield 'computing';
  ///
  ///       final result = await [state, suffix].join(''); // asume join is async, or a network call, etc.
  ///
  ///       yield result;
  ///     },
  ///   );
  /// }
  /// ```
  ///
  ///
  ///
  /// If the [updater] function crashes during execution, the last yielded state
  /// will be kept (meaning there is no rollback).
  /// So if you emit intermediate state (like loading) be sure to use `try/catch/finally`
  /// to not leave the bloc hanging in a pending state for eternity.
  /// The error will be captured and be reported to the current [Zone] for error handling.
  /// You can intercept these errors by wrapping your [runApp] in a [runZoned]
  /// and providing a callback to the `onError` parameter.
  ///
  /// A note for testing: A function passed as [updater] should not call [run] itself
  /// (neither directly nor indirectly), as that makes testing hard as the completion
  /// of the bloc can not be awaited properly.
