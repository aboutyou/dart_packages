# sign_in_with_apple_example

Demonstrates how to use the sign_in_with_apple plugin.

## macOS

> While we prefer to install `cocoapods` via `bundler`, Flutter currently needs a global cocoapods installation to gather the plugin information.
> If you don't have the `pod` binary installed globally, you'll see an error like `CocoaPods not installed or not in valid state.`

```sh
flutter config --enable-macos-desktop
# cd macos && bundle exec pod install && cd -
flutter run -d macOS
```
